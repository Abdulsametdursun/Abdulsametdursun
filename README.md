About Me

ðŸ’» Currently, I am a Full-Stack Developer at Mimcode, focusing on backend development with Node.js and Express. My work involves building scalable and efficient backend services, developing RESTful APIs, and managing databases for large-scale projects.

ðŸŽ“ I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from North American University, where I built a strong foundation in software development.

ðŸŒ± I have extensive experience with programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, Node.js, Python, CSS, HTML, React.js, Express, SQL, and MongoDB.

ðŸš€ Before Mimcode, I specialized in front-end development at Udemig, where I crafted responsive, user-centric interfaces using React, HTML, and CSS and optimized web applications for mobile devices.

ðŸ“š My journey in software development started with an internship at Bordo BiliÅŸim Ticaret Ltd. Åžti, where I gained significant experience in front-end development and test case creation.

ðŸ”¢ Fun Fact: I served as the Vice President of the Math Club at my university, where I nurtured my love for problem-solving and analytical thinking.
