**Welcome to My GitHub Profile!**

I graduated from North American University with a bachelor's degree in computer science in May 2024. I interned at Bordo Bili≈üim Ticaret Ltd. ≈ûti for over five months, specializing in front-end and test case development. 
At Udemy, I initially focused on front-end development, crafting user interfaces with React, HTML, and CSS while ensuring mobile responsiveness. I expanded my role to include back-end tasks, similar to my current work at Mimcode, involving React optimization, RESTful API development with Node.js and Express, and database management with SQL and MongoDB.
I am proficient in React, NodeJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python, and Microsoft SQL Server, with additional skills in Photoshop and AutoCAD. A proactive learner and team player, I am always ready to take on new challenges and have a strong passion for cars.
